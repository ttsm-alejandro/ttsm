                                        for their employees in the factory. They reviewed the production line from an 
                                        ergonomic point of view and changed it so that even employees with lack of 
                                        strength can work without burden, and introduced a mechanism that makes it 
                                        easy to handle large parts by applying physical mechanism. Thanks to the device, 
                                        it has become a workplace where many women work, which is unusual in the industry.

                                        In recent years, demands for high-tensile strength steel (HTSS) which is thin and 
                                        holds high strength have been increased due to the progressed technologies in the 
                                        auto industry. The stronger the material gets, the more difficult it is to mold it 
                                        into a panel, and it requires accurate measurement analysis and correction at the 
                                        earlier stage before it gets too late to remold it. In order to make it smoother 
                                        and accurate, they introduced “<a href="../products/camera/EN_cometL3d2Base.html">COMET</a>”, a non-contact 3D measuring machine which 
                                        Tokyo Boeki Techno-System introduced in March 2015.

                                        We interviewed them to ask what kind of problems they had with conventional measuring

                                        As a significant background, the whole automotive industry as a whole started 
                                        focusing on “high strength and weight reduction of vehicles” considering 
                                        environmental performance and collision safety. Among these, materials with extremely
                                        high strength such as high-tensile steel and ultra-high-tensile steel were used. 
                                        Even if the plate thickness is reduced, the same strength as the conventional steel 
                                        plate can be obtained, and the parts can be significantly reduced in weight.
                                        The more hardness the material has, the more processing problems there are, such 
                                        as cracks, wrinkles, and spring-backs (a phenomenon that the press-processed part 
                                        on the material goes back to the form before pressed.) That’s why pursuing the 
                                        accuracy is quite challenging and it requires several times of shape measurement 
                                        and accuracy-estimated corrections. Therefore, we wanted to realize the process
                                        of measuring the panel in the middle of molding from the earliest possible stage, 
                                        grasping exactly what was wrong, and fixing the bad point pinpointed.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Previously, the main purpose was to check the finished panel, so we used a laser
                                        measuring machine. However, considering the increased number of process measurements
                                        and the handling of large parts, it is much more convenient to introduce a new non-contact
                                        3D measurement system.

                                        Besides, the chassis and body parts are very large, so workers have to move to 
                                        measure with a conventional measuring machine, and the work of bending and stretching 
                                        their waist is physically difficult. It is also tough to do such jobs in a factory 
                                        where it’s very hot in summer and cold in winter. On the other hand, we can work 
                                        in a well-organized environment with a non-contact 3D measurement system and reduce

                                        Yes, we considered another company’s product their product was cheaper
                                        considering only the unit cost, but Tokyo Boeki Techno-System was more
                                        reasonable considering the development cost of the necessary functions,
                                        so I chose Tokyo Boeki Techno-system by comparing the total cost.

                                        Other than the total cost, we also noticed the measurement data quality.
                                        Other company’s product corrects measurement data a little too much.
                                        The data of tiny dents and scars are smoothed and are not seen on the display.
                                        It looks beautiful on the screen, but what we need is “accurately measured shape”
                                        which even includes those tiny dents and shape changes so that we can fix panels
                                        and molds perfectly.

                                        to measure widely increased, and measurement accuracy increased.
                                        When labor that was used for measurement with conventional measurement 
                                        machine is 100, we were expecting it would be 200 as the number of 
                                        measurement time and parts drastically increased after introducing
                                        high-tensile steel. However, <a href="../products/camera/EN_cometL3d2Base.html">COMET</a> reduces the physical burden of
                                        measurement and shortens the time it takes. Even if the number of 
                                        measurements and measurement parts increase, the total effort is about 80.

                                        The preparation term for mass production is getting shorter and shorter, 
                                        and there is also a request from the post-process, such as “We want to 
                                        correct the accuracy as soon as the panel comes out”. The real intention
                                        of the site is to take more time to fix than to measure. The correction 
                                        cycle has become shorter as the measurement result can be told shortly 
                                        after the measurement.

                                        By measuring the thickness and mold of the process panel and applying 
                                        the values to the simulation, the accuracy of desktop verification has
                                        been greatly improved.

                                        It can be made quite a lot at the simulation stage, and the number 
                                        of actual panel and mold corrections has been reduced. Even when corrections
                                        are made, accurate numerical values can be transmitted to the mold production 
                                        department, enabling high-accurate correction at an early stage. By comparing
                                        the measured point cloud and CAD, it is possible to cut the interference part 
                                        in advance.

                                        To be honest, I think that the verification between the desk verification
                                        and the production site was not successful before. It was not efficient
                                        because there were discussions with sensory values. The person in charge
                                        of desk verification does not know the details of the site, and the person
                                        in charge of production does not know the desk verification. Because there
                                        were few opportunities to know each other's work.
                                        <br><br>
                                        However, after the introduction of <a href="../products/camera/EN_cometL3d2Base.html">COMET</a>, it is possible to share "how much 
                                        distorted" thanks to accurate measurement values and color maps at a glance. 
                                        For mold engineers, it is clear with the numerical value and color that 
                                        “how many mm you can cut if you move your hand” and “which part you should 
                                        cut”, it helps to improve the technology by combining the sense and the 
                                        current situation.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Previously, even if the quality was adjusted with the first mold, there 
                                        was no change log for the parts that were shaved by hand, so it took as
                                        much time as the first to make the second and third molds. Now, the second
                                        and subsequent dies can be quickly produced from the data. This is because
                                        the parts that have been corrected manually can be woven into the CAD, and
                                        an accurate shape can be created by machining.
                                        <br><br>
                                        I think that the information exchange between departments has increased
                                        through the measured values of <a href="../products/camera/EN_cometL3d2Base.html">COMET</a>, such as the analysis team and the 
                                        mold production team, our company and other companies. Now that we have 
                                        regular meetings on measured values, the speed of quality development 
                                        has accelerated considerably. I feel that I can appreciate the information
                                        based on the correct information.

                                        I think it is necessary to have a basic knowledge of what 
                                        angle the measurement object should be taken from and why.
                                        In that respect, at the time of introduction, I took a lecture
                                        on from Tokyo Boeki Techno-system and they taught me exactly
                                        what I did not understand. Currently, we are educating how
                                        to use it only within the company.

                                        We are also studying how to use them. At first, it was introduced 
                                        for the purpose of measuring the shape of the process panel. However,
                                        since there was a suggestion to measure the plate thickness, a trial 
                                        and error made it possible to find a method for accurate measurement 
                                        with <a href="../products/camera/EN_cometL3d2Base.html">COMET</a>. Previously, it was difficult to accurately measure the 
                                        thickness of the plate, but after improving the measurement method
                                        repeatedly and verifying it over and over again, we were able to obtain
                                        a proof that accurate values were obtained. We are applying for a patent
                                        in cooperation with Tokyo Boeki Techno-system.

                                        The key to our performance index is the accuracy of spring-back
                                        and plate thickness. This is very useful for increasing the degree 
                                        of perfection by increasing the consistency with the simulation, so
