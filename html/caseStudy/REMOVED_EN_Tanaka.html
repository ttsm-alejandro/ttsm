                                        parts for major automobile manufacturers since being founded in 1948. Their 
                                        main products are the parts which influence smooth running, such as engines, 
                                        transmissions, and chassis. As higher performance is demanded, higher precision
                                        and durability of the parts are needed. Tanaka Seimitsu Kogyo has been 
                                        satisfying the needs by improving their technique and having more sites.

                                        one of the most regarded companies in Toyama Prefecture. Recently it has been
                                        expanding their manufacturing business, acquiring ISO9001, JISQ9001, and JISQ9100

                                        Their most notable activity is establishment of “T-IReC (tii-airekku)” in December, 
                                        2017. It renovated a plant into a research center dedicated to researching advanced 
                                        technology in Toyama City, and started their own research to achieve efficiency and 
                                        labor-saving in their future plants. Taking charge of one subject, such as AI, 
                                        machining automation, centralization of operating information, each employee 
                                        in the research center is conducting research on functions and conditions for 
                                        use of the machines to be installed to each site in 2022.

                                        In the studies of 3D measuring system automation among those activities, they 
                                        introduced “<a href="../products/camera/REMOVED_EN_cometL3d2Base.html">COMET</a>”, a non-contact 3D measuring device, from Tokyo Boeki 
                                        Techno-System Ltd. It is a cost-efficient product in which a robot, software, 
                                        and measuring device are set, with the software that allows non-robot-experts to
                                        create teaching data.

                                        I asked them in detail about the reason why they selected this product out of
                                        various measuring devices, how they will use it in their future plants, and what
                                        studies they are performing for that purpose.

                                        Mr. Kenji Kuse (Kuse, hereinafter): 2018 was a milestone year for our company;
                                        it was the 70th anniversary since being founded. We have been recognized as a
                                        good manufacturer of small precision parts, such as engines, chassis, transmissions,
                                        meeting the needs from manufacturers of motors, automobiles and motorbikes. 
                                        We are confident in our parts whose quality is technically and performance-wise 
                                        high enough to be used for racing cars.

                                        However, the way in which orders are placed has changed in recent years. We used 
                                        to receive orders requesting “to produce such parts” with 2D drawings shown and 
                                        then started considering necessary dimensions and materials based on the drawings.
                                        However, we have received more orders only with 3D CAD data without drawings for these 
                                        past 5 years.

                                        Because there is no shape drawing, we need to confirm arcs and angles in 
                                        the 3D data in order to actually produce aluminum die-cast products in the 
                                        production site. And after forming, we need to accurately measure the work 
                                        piece to check “whether it is precisely formed in accordance with the 3D data”
                                        and qualify it. It was very difficult to maintain precision of the contact-type
                                        measuring device we were using then. We came up with an idea that we should 
                                        introduce a non-contact measuring device to realize “faster and more accurate”
                                        measurement.

                                        There was another important movement in our business. Although we have handled 
                                        small parts, we want to expand our business to manufacture large parts and parts 
                                        in areas other than automobiles/motorbikes. To acquire more orders for them, 
                                        we should not respond in an old-fashioned manner. We thought that we would be 
                                        in the phase of fundamentally reviewing the direction in our plants, and the personnel
                                        arrangement.

                                        We started the discussion about it in 2016. Because we wanted to substantially
                                        shorten the measuring time, a non-contact automated measurement system was major 
                                        premise. We were not in full knowledge of the products, so to collect information 
                                        about the basic mechanism and trends we went first to exhibitions where measuring
                                        device manufacturers gathered. We discussed 20 to 30 models, considering our application.
                                        <br><br>
                                        In fact, we introduced one measuring device from another company in 2017 because
                                        we thought it would match our application of qualifying the shapes after forming. 
                                        However, about a year after the introduction, the need, “we would like to check 
                                        the shape in the middle of the production process as well” arose from the production
                                        site. The measuring device we introduced could measure various shapes accurately, 
                                        but it took a lot of time. We could select the second device soon because we felt
                                        that “<a href="../products/camera/REMOVED_EN_cometL3d2Base.html">COMET</a>” must be good for high-speed measurement during mass production” in 
                                        our first discussion.

                                        Its camera for picture-taking is single-lens reflex, which is beneficial for us.
                                        In case of a compound-eye camera, overlapped data on the software is thinned. 
                                        But we want data of the precise shape of the workpiece at hand. For that reason,
                                        the measuring device with a single-lens reflex camera is the best to capture

                                        <strong>Ms. Tsubota (Tsubota, hereinafter): </strong> We know the time for 
                                        shape confirmation measurement will be greatly shortened in the production 
                                        site. For example, the work which took a whole day with the previous measuring 
                                        device, can be completed within 30 minutes with “<a href="../products/camera/REMOVED_EN_cometL3d2Base.html">COMET</a>”. It is also better at
                                        measuring glossy surfaces than expected. Because molds for die-cast change as
                                        it is being used, it will be useful for quality control if we can understand 
                                        the change daily.

                                        However, the usage conditions should be adequately examined to achieve maximum efficiency at each plant. There is oily smoke, powder dust, wide temperature change, vibration in the production process, and so on in the production site. What environment should be prepared to measure accurate values under such conditions? Conversely, in what range of conditions, value fluctuations can be ignored? I am verifying the optimal usage for each site, because necessary conditions are different depending on the place and product to be measured.

                                        <br><strong>Tsubota: </strong> When we installed it, an instructor came from Tokyo Boeki Techno-System and provided a one-on-one training on the operation for 4 days. In addition, I took a 3-day seminar at Toyama Vocational Skills Development Center to learn the basic knowledge about 3D measurement and the concept of capturing surfaces. I also took a training of industrial robots after being assigned.

I started using it in September. I always ask the support center when I don't understand something, even if that is a basic question, such as, “what to do when this screen is displayed”. I email him with images or I call him when in a hurry. I have no worry because he responds immediately. 
<br><br>
<strong>Kuse: </strong>Performance-wise, I feel technology has been advancing so much when I see the software creates even a measuring program. When a workpiece is set in the simulation, the arm automatically turns round and round, measurement points are found, and the program is sent to the robot. I believe that such convenience will be key to solve personnel shortage when it is introduced to all our sites.
<br><br>
In addition, I feel secure because one person in charge becomes point of contact and advises us, understanding our use environment and purpose. When a problem occurred once, he explained the situation accurately and frankly, showing some recovery plans. At last it was solved much faster than expected, so I recognized his high response capability.

                                        The integration of various technologies could promote labor-saving, such as automatic measurement by reading 2D barcodes made on products, and the entire plant having self-diagnosis function which allows automatic operation up to idling. We also consider selling our system to improve efficiency in plants as a package in the future.

I believe that there is still more room for it in the manufacturing industry.

Being founded as Tanaka Seisakusho in 1948, the company became Tanaka Kinzoku Kogyo Limited Liability Company in 1951. It then changed its name to “Tanaka Seimitsu Kogyo” in 1955 and incorporated itself in 1957. It has been developing their business mainly in manufacturing and sale of automobile/motorbike parts, being highly regarded as a supplier of high-precision/high-performance parts. It established “T-IReC”, a research center for advanced technology, in December, 2017. It has been conducting research there with a view to achieving efficiency and labor-saving in their future plants, separately from manufacturing technology development. It is planning to introduce the results of their research to their business sites in and outside Japan by 2022.
