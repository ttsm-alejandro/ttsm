                                        Rinnai Corporation, celebrating its 100th anniversary 
                                        in 2020, was founded in 1920 as the “Rinnai Shokai”, taking the 
                                        letters of the founders Kaneyoshi Hayashi and Shujiro Naito. With 
                                        sales offices nationwide based in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture, the 
                                        company has grown into a global company that forms the Rinnai
                                        Group of 15 domestic companies and 31 overseas companies. The
                                        business that started with the manufacture and sale of pressurized 
                                        oil stoves has been expanded into gas appliances such as gas table
                                        stoves, gas ranges, gas stoves, and gas water heaters.

                                        The technical power and safety performance that was related to aircraft 
                                        manufacturing in the past have been applied to precise design. The 
                                        product group that can withstand the hard working environment has 
                                        also been highly evaluated.
                                        <br><br>
                                        In the future, we would like to expand in fields that contribute
                                        to the environment, health, and time savings. We are developing
                                        technologies that achieve high efficiency through hybrids with
                                        electricity and products that change the common sense of gas equipment.
                                        Among them, clothes dryers that use gas and Dutch ovens that make use
                                        of the strength of direct fire are gradually attracting attention.

                                        An indispensable thing for efficient use of thermal energy is a
                                        mechanical design that precisely controls gas and air and precise 
                                        mold fabrication. The non-contact 3D measuring machine “<a href="../products/camera/EN_cometL3d2Base.html">COMET</a>” 
                                        of Tokyo Boeki Techno-System was used in the field, and it succeeded
                                        in cutting costs and shortening the construction period by using it
                                        for mold production and molding measurement. The measured 3D data can
                                        be visually analyzed and compared with the CAD comparison inspection
                                        software "spGauge", so you can immediately share information on the
                                        distortion points and differences.
                                        <br><br>
                                        This time, we asked in detail about the benefits of using a non-contact
                                        3D measuring machine in the development, and in what situation the cost
                                        reduction was realized.

                                        comparison and inspection software "spGauge" in 2008. They are 
                                        mostly used for the process to check if a prototype matches its
                                        drawings in early production process of new products.

                                        <strong> Mr. Taiki Harada (hereinafter referred to Harada):</strong>
                                        As the development process for new products progresses, it moves to 
                                        factory production preparation. One of my department's roles is to
                                        reduce return loss and defective products. When the prototype is
                                        measured in 3D, the difference between the molded product and the
                                        drawing can be seen. Based on this data, the mold is corrected and 
                                        the machining tool is changed, which leads to accurate product 
                                        manufacturing.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Our products such as gas stoves and water heaters have many 
                                        extremely complicated drawing shapes consisting of curved parts. 
                                        Previously it was measured with an analog R gauge or a contact
                                        measuring machine, but accurate values cannot be obtained for 
                                        continuous surfaces of different R. However, with <a href="../products/camera/EN_cometL3d2Base.html">COMET</a>, you 
                                        can acquire point cloud data at intervals of 0.2 mm with a single
                                        shot, and you can see fine distortion and dents on the surface. In
                                        the analysis software, you can see 3D visuals in which color change
                                        depending on the degree of distortion and you can share it at a

                                        <strong>Muto: </strong> Producing prototypes costs time and money. 
                                        The first good point after introducing <a href="../products/camera/EN_cometL3d2Base.html">COMET</a> was that the difference
                                        between the mold and the prototype could be understood immediately,
                                        and the number of mold rework and correction was drastically reduced.
                                        This reduced the prototype cost by nearly half depending on the year.
                                        This is a pretty big achievement as a company.
                                        <br><br>
                                        In the past, skilled engineers judged the parts that could not be
                                        measured based on empirical rules and repeated trial and error. 
                                        Then the prototype cost was that much higher. Now it is possible 
                                        to measure in detail, and anyone can see the degree of distortion
                                        with numerical values and images, so the quality can be achieved 
                                        with the second trial production.

                                        measured product data, the accuracy of CAE has improved 
                                        dramatically, and the number of prototypes has been greatly 
                                        reduced. I noticed this later, but it was really good.

                                        We are handling functional parts such as burners. In the old days, it was 
                                        actually burned to see if the function worked properly. 
                                        <br>
                                        There was an engineer who could tell what was wrong with the mold by 
                                        checking how the flame came out. However, there is no data left anywhere 
                                        on the shape of the mold that they finely shaved and polished.
                                        When renewing products or replacing worn molds, those new molds 
                                        were recreated from scratch.
                                        <br><br>
                                        We thought that it was necessary to change the situation in which mold 
                                        performance was determined by personal skills and we needed an environment 
                                        in which anyone could understand the part shape precisely and reproduce it.
                                        Then we started considering introduction of a 3D non-contact measuring machine.

                                        destiny (our livelihood depends on the quality of our products)".
                                        There is a strong commitment to quality, and the spirit of making a 
                                        higher-grade product has been a thriving corporate culture. I believed 
                                        others would be convinced if I persuaded in terms of investment that

                                        of this measuring machine also encouraged the introduction. As it 
                                        took a lot of money and time to make the mold, it was calculated that 
                                        introduction of the measuring machine would recover at least that part
                                        from the beginning.

                                        used to take several years has been shortened by several months, or the 
                                        measurement that took three days has been completed in less than one day.
                                        As a result, the time and technical benefits are gradually known within 
                                        the company. At the beginning, the system allowed only a limited number

                                        different, we changed the system so that <a href="../products/camera/EN_cometL3d2Base.html">COMET</a> can be used by employees 
                                        in development departments, mold departments, and affiliated companies.

                                        precautions and basic operations, and then register the users. The registrants
                                        can book the machine via online reservation system. Because of this system,

                                        and value-added jobs. Every year checks on shortening the development
                                        period and prototyping costs is getting stricter. We think that <a href="../products/camera/EN_cometL3d2Base.html">COMET</a>
                                        is a great help to build things quickly and accurately.

                                        Established in 1920 as Rinnai Shokai, and changed its name to Rinnai Corporation in 1971. Starting with the manufacture and sales of pressurized oil stoves, they have built trust and track record as a company that handles gas equipment such as gas table stoves, gas ranges, gas stoves, and gas water heaters. Currently, it has the top share in domestic gas stove sales. Towards 2020, the 100th anniversary of its founding, the “Rinnai” logo has been renewed in 2019, and we are making products that contribute not only to technology and safety, but also to the environment, health, and time savings.
